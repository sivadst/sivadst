# 👨‍🚀 Selvasiva S | Data Science Voyager 🌌

Hey there, I’m Selvasiva — an Integrated M.Tech Data Science student at SRM AP, quietly building real-world solutions that orbit between logic and imagination. I code not just to solve, but to **see** — patterns in data, stories in numbers, and meaning in every dataset.

📍 Currently learning & building in:
- 🚀 Astroinformatics (NASA Asteroid Tracker ✅)
- 📊 Data Analytics & Dashboards
- 🤖 Machine Learning & Model Evaluation
- 🧠 Deep Learning with PyTorch
- 🌐 API Integration & Automation
- ☁️ Cloud Deployments & SQL Engineering

📘 Capstone: [NASA NEO Dashboard](https://github.com/sivadst/NASA_NEO_DASHBOARD)  
Built from scratch using real-time NASA data, this system processes over **10,000+ asteroid entries**, cleans & stores them in SQL, and visualizes space threats using Streamlit.  
*Powered by: Python, APIs, SQLite, SQL, Streamlit.*
